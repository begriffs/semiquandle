Files used in my and Scott Pellicane's effort to classify all
semiquandles.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biquandle

The results/ folder contains a PDF chart of the operation tables of
small semiquandles and graphs of the way various sizes embed in one
another. It also contains a paper with our theorems-in-progress.

The catalogue/ folder contains lists of all semiquandles from size
2-8 up to isomorphism. They are in the LADR format used by the Prover9
family of programs. You can switch their formats using interpformat.

These models were generated with Mace4.
