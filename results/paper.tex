\title{Classification of Finite Symmetric Biquandles}

\author{Joe Nelson}
\author{Scott Pellicane}

\begin{abstract}
The goal is to classify finite symmetric biquandles, or semiquandles, first defined in \cite{aH10}.

We present an infinite class of simple semiquandles of prime order.

\section{Definition of a Semiquandle}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A \emph{semiquandle} is a system $(X,\nearrow,\searrow)$ such that $X$ is a nonempty set and $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ are binary functions on $X$ satisfying:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\exists!{c}$ $(a = c^b)$,
\item $\exists!{c}$ $(a = c_b)$,
\item $a_b = b \Leftrightarrow b^a = a$,
\item $(a_b)^{(b^a)} = a$,
\item $(a^b)_{(b_a)} = a$,
\item $(a^b)^c = (a^{c_b})^{b^c}$,
\item $(a_b)_c = (a_{c^b})_{b_c}$,
\item $(a_b)^{c_{b^a}} = (a^c)_{b^{c_a}}$,
\end{enumerate}
where the free variables in (1-8) are universally quantified. A \emph{Latin semiquandle} is a semiquandle satisfying $\forall{ab}$ $\exists!{c}$ $(a=b^c)$ and $\forall{ab}$ $\exists!{c}$ $(a=b_c)$. See \cite{aH10} for where the definition first appeared.

\subsection{Semiquandles of Constant Action}

\begin{thm}
Let $\varphi \in S_n$. The operations given by $a^{b} = \varphi(a)$ and $a_b = \varphi^{-1}(a)$ form
a semiquandle on $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ which we denote by $C(\varphi)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We go through the axioms in turn.

For (1): Given 

For (2):

For (3):

For (4):

For (5):

For (6):

For (7):

For (8):


Note that this appeared in \cite{aH10} without proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
A semiquandle is \emph{of constant action} if it equals $C(\varphi)$ for some $\varphi$.
\end{definition}

\begin{thm}
All semiquandles smaller than size three are simple and of constant action.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Computer exhaustion reveals there are three semiquandles (up to isomorphism) smaller than
size three. They are of constant action. There is no way to partition a set of size one or two
other than trivially, so the semiquandles are simple.
\end{proof}

We can relate properties of the group $\langle\varphi\rangle$ to those of the semiquandle $C(\varphi)$.
The following theorem establishes that non-simplicity begets non-simplicity.

\begin{thm}
Let $\varphi \in S_n$. If $N \lhd \langle\varphi\rangle$ then there is a congruence on
$C(\varphi)$ having $\left|\langle\varphi\rangle : N\right|$ classes.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Define a relation $\sim$ on $C(\varphi)$ by $\varphi^{i}(0) \sim \varphi^{j}(0)$ iff the cosets $N\varphi^{i} = N\varphi^{j}$. $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. Now suppose some $\varphi^{i}(0) \sim \varphi^{j}(0)$. Then by normality $N\varphi^{i+1} = N\varphi^{i}N\varphi = N\varphi^{j}N\varphi = N\varphi^{j+1}$. Hence $a \sim b$ implies $\varphi(a) \sim \varphi(b)$ and $\varphi^{-1}(a) \sim \varphi^{-1}(b)$ for any $a$, $b \in C(\varphi)$. Thus $\sim$ is a congruence.

[TODO: why are the congruences distinct?]

\bigskip

Let $B_1$, $B_2$ be blocks of a partition $\theta \in Con(C(\varphi))$ such that $n > \left|B_1\right| > \left|B_2\right| > 1$. Goal: $\left|B_1\right| = \left|B_2\right|$.

\bigskip

First, if any block $B$ of $\theta$ is closed (as an element of the semiquandle quotient structure), then $B$ contains all elements of $C(\varphi))$: $\varphi^k(\varphi^i(0)) \in B$ for all $k$.

\bigskip


\end{proof}

The other direction does not hold in general. Permutations which generate simple groups don't
always induce simple semiquandles of constant action. Here is where the trouble occurs.

\begin{thm}
If $\varphi \in S_{n > 2}$ fixes an element then $C(\varphi)$ is not simple.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $\varphi$ fixes $x$ and consider the partition $\{ \{x\}, C(\varphi) \setminus \{x\} \}$.
If $a \sim b$ under the induced equivalence relation then either both or neither equal $x$.
So both or neither of $\varphi(a)$, $\varphi(b)$ equal $x$, making $\varphi(a) \sim \varphi(b)$.
Hence the partition is a nontrivial congruence.
\end{proof}

The following shows the source of all simple semiquandles of constant action: permutations
which generate simple groups and which fix nothing.

\begin{thm}
Let $p$ be prime and let $\varphi$ be a p-cycle in the symmetric group $S_p$.
Then $C(\varphi)$ is simple.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $\Theta$ be a congruence on $C(\varphi)$. Suppose $\Theta$ has a class with
at least two elements, $a$ and $b$. We will show that this class is all of
$C(\varphi)$, and hence that $\Theta$ is trivial.

Since $\varphi$ is a cycle, $b = \varphi^{i}(a)$ for some $i$; hence
$\varphi^{i}(a) \equiv \varphi^{0}(a)$. Since $\Theta$ is a congruence $\varphi^{i}(a) =
\varphi^{i}(\varphi^{0}(a)) \equiv \varphi^{i}(\varphi^{i}(a)) = \varphi^{2i}(a)$. By transitivity,
$a \equiv \varphi^{2i}(a)$. Repeating the process gives $a \equiv \varphi^{ni}(a)$ for any $n$.

If $c$ is an arbitrary element of $C(\varphi)$, then $c = \varphi^{j}(a)$ for some $j$.
Since the $\varphi$ has prime order in $S_p$, there exists an $n$ with
$\varphi^{j} = \varphi^{ni}$ so $a \equiv \varphi^{ni}(a) = c$.
\end{proof}
